# Football Life

Football Life is a simple program created to make life easier for the
human being, in this case, of members of a football club, whether they are directors, coaches or even athletes. The user can also ask for a different look/layout.
This program is developed in C, on codeblocks.

### How it all began
Nowadays there are some clubs that the organization is not very good and they don't have the money to help them either, so I decided to make a program where this would change. Despite being a very simple one, it will be accessible and easy to understand for all clubs to have access to.
As my abilities are not very big yet, we can say that this was a small sketch and, who knows, that I may still be able to develop it in the future.

### Idealized Program
This program was supposed to be a program where it had all the functions that a club needed, but I had some difficulties in developing some of these functions and it turned out to be just a simple program, although it has the main tasks.
